# Melon Software Library

Core library for some C projects that are by Knot126, "Decent Games" or "Descentix Software."

## Support

This library is **not currently supported** very well, and there is a lot of messy code. It probably shouldn't be used in seroius projects until it evolves more.

## Including in Projects

To include in projects, add the `.c` files in the `src` folder to the projects files.
